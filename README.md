This is a windows app that you can stream or download anime from it for absolutely free without paying a pennie

Ronime is in baby stages and I still have a lot to add to it but it is usable and pretty nice **( I always use it myself )**

**some of you might say "Why didn't this guy upload the source code?" that is cause I don't wanna share Ronime's source code and I just wanna share Ronime so that anyone can enjoy anime, forget the code**

# ⚠ Important :

Ronime doesn't have, at least for now, any built in vidoe player so you need to set a player in its settings,
Ronime has to support any player that has streaming feature but I only tried my two favorite players which are **MPC-BE** and **Potplayer** and they worked like a charm, so you just open an issue in the repo and let me know if your player doesn't work with it

I know, I know, Ronime interface isn't beautiful and I'll make it better later (If i have time tho)

Just open an issue if you spot any errors or anything
