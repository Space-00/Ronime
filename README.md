**This is my first ever app and I hope you'll love it, it is called Ronime and it is for anime lovers**

# Ronime

This is a windows app that you can stream or download anime from it for absolutely free without paying a pennie

Ronime is in baby stages and I still have a lot to add to it but it is usable and pretty nice (I use it myself every day)

**some of you might say "Why didn't this guy upload the source code?" that is cause I don't wanna share Ronime's source code and I just wanna share Ronime so that anyone can enjoy anime, forget the code**

# ⚠ Important :

Ronime doesn't have, at least for now, any built in vidoe player so you need to set a player in its settings
Ronime has to support any player that has streaming option but I only tried my two favorite players which are **MPC-BE** and **Potplayer** and they worked like a charm, so you just open an issue in the repo and let me know if your player doesn't work with it

Just open an issue if you spot any errors or anything in the app
