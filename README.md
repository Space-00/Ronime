Ronime is a windows app that you can stream or download anime from it for absolutely free without paying a pennie

Ronime is in üë∂üèªbabyüë∂üèª stages and I still have a lot to add to it so you may see bugs and crashes now but it is usable and pretty nice so give it a try and test it for yourself

Get Ronime from here: [Download]()

**some of you might say "Why didn't this guy upload the source code?" that is cause I don't wanna share Ronime's source code and I just wanna share Ronime so that anyone can enjoy anime, forget the code**

Guys I need your feedbacks and ideas or any suggestion, so tell me about them [here](https://github.com/Space-00/Ronime/issues) , thank you in advance cause I'm a solo developer for this app and I need you guys' feddbacks to make it better

[Ronime notes](https://github.com/Space-00/Ronime/blob/main/Version.md)

# ‚ùó Disclaimer ‚ùó :

Ronime doesn't host anything, not a single anime, not even the covers, nothing

# ‚ö† Important :

Ronime doesn't have, at least for now, any built in vidoe player so you need to set a player in its settings,
Ronime has to support any player that has streaming feature but I only tried my two favorite players which are [MPC-BE](https://github.com/Aleksoid1978/MPC-BE) and [Potplayer](https://potplayer.daum.net/) and they worked like a charm, so you just open an issue in the repo and let me know if your player doesn't work with it

üçø Streaming üçø - when you wanna stream an anime, Ronime will open the player that you set in its settings for it then it will use that player to stream the anime

‚¨á Downloading ‚¨á - when you ask for the download links, Ronime will get the download links of that episode or those episodes and put them in a txt file as the same name of that anime, then you open it and see the download links, as beautiful as that

I know, I know, Ronime doesn't have a beautiful and fancy appearance and I'll make it better later (idk when though)
